<h1>Assessment 3: Web Futures</h1>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p>By Forest.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Your decision-making process in selecting the topic and incorporating AI-generated content.</strong></p>
<p>I selected the topic as I didnt know what else to do and figured it would be easy to make something semi aesthetic with assets I already have. I incorporated Chat-GPT to help me integrate scroll animations into the website as a starting base for content as I do not know how to do many scroll animations but wanted to use them for previous UI type/website assignments and when trying I’ve been mostly unsuccessful in the past, I gave Chat-GPT some code as a reference/example as I wasn’t getting the results I wanted in terms of the animation effect. I also used Chat-GPT to enhance the product cards based on the ones used in my previous assignment as I wanted icons but didn't know how to even start integrating them into a website as I have never really needed to learn how to before. I found it very difficult to get Chat-GPT to give the outputs I wanted, I know it has to do with wording but I think I’m just not very good at articulating what I wanted it to do and that is something I think I need to work on as I did find it kinda discouraging.</p> 
<p><strong>How you leveraged front-end concepts to achieve your design goals.</strong></p>
<p>I have tried out two different scroll effects and some additional hover to the cards but this is by no means a functional website as I didn't really achieve my design goals outside of it being somewhat aesthetically alright.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges encountered and solutions devised during the development process.</strong></p>
<p>During the process I found that the parallax scroll animation code would throw off the typical header and Footer set up I had going, I ended up having to choose a fixed header which really annoyed me as I really wanted them to all be consistent but in the end after lots of attempts to resolve it I just kinda gave up, the original header meant that there was this weird box around the images and I really did not want that so this is the sacrifice I had to make. 
  <br>I had lots of smaller issues especially with alignment during this assignment with things like the images on the snap scroll page, I did just adjust the actual images themselves outside of coding but I would have liked to have learned how to align them better so I could perhaps have the items in the center and have them scale down properly but I was unable to come up with a way to do this and eventually just stuck with what I have as I couldn’t even get Chat-GPT to show me how to fix this.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons learned and improvements you would implement in future projects.</strong></p>
<p>In future I would have hoped to make product pages and a functional cart and have the heart/saved system/user account visible and functioning but I just did not have the time and ability to do so as I have been struggling with health issues that have really limited my ability to complete assignments to any kind of reasonable standard, I am not satisfied with my current outcome but I do not feel I am able to complete it to any further standard right now.</p>
